# Assignments for Numerical Partial Differential Equations

This is the repository of assignments of the course *Stochastic Simulation* lectured by *Tiejun Li* in Fall 2018. The author of this repository is [Zhihan Li](mailto:lzh2016p@pku.edu.cn).

This repository relies on the personal TeX templates package [ptmpls](https://github.com/pppppass/ptmpls). Remember to specify `--recursive` option when cloning the repository. After cloning, one needs to execute `make` in the `ptmpls` folder to generate this package.

## Organization

There are several sub folders in this repository:
1. `LxxExercise`: Written exercise for lecture `xx`.
